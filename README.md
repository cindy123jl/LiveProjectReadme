# LiveProjectReadme
I was a part of a two week long live project where we had sprint meetings Monday-Friday.
In this team project I created a Donations page for the Theatres Website and I also created the MVC for the Rental Request form.
I am very passionate about how the final project looks like, so I made sure to make these as user friendly and aesthetically pleasing as I
could within the time frame.

#For the Rental Request Form
While creating this, I was able to really develop a deeper understanding of the .NET Framework and the MVC pattern. Some subtle changes I made 
to the styling is the submit buttons where they were not visable with the default changes in creating the MVC pattern, I made them into easy to see buttons.
